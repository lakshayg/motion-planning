abstract = {In this paper, we present a search-based motion planning algorithm for manipulation that handles the high dimensionality of the problem and minimizes the limitations associated with employing a strict set of pre-defined actions. Our approach employs a set of adaptive motion primitives comprised of static motions with variable dimensionality and on-the-fly motions generated by two analytical solvers. This method results in a slimmer, multi-dimensional lattice and offers the ability to satisfy goal constraints with precision. To validate our approach, we used a 7DOF manipulator to perform experiments on a real mobile manipulation platform (Willow Garage's PR2). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the planner in efficiently navigating cluttered spaces; the method generates consistent, low-cost motion trajectories, and guarantees the search is complete with bounds on the suboptimality of the solution.},
